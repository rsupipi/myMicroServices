# (1) Microservices
	1.  REST
	2. Cloud enabled
	3. small well chosen deploy-able units.

## 1.1 chalenges
	1. Bounded context -> identify the boundry for each services.
	2. configuration management -> different pods in different environments `57_configuration_management.PNG`
	3. Visibility [how do i know all are up and runing]
	4. Pack of cards [fault tolerance] `58_pack of cards.PNG`
	    service1 call service2, service2 calls service3.. so on.. If the last (fundamental basic service down the hole
	    application will gose down.
	5. Configuration Management -> monitoring services
	6. Dynamic scale up and scale down.

# (2) Solutions

## 2.1 configuration management

### 2.1.1 Spring cloud config server
`59_springCloudConfig_Server.PNG` 

One of the challenges we talked about earlier was configuration management. We talked about the fact that there would be
multiple microservices multiple environments for each of these microservices and multiple instances in many of those 
environments. This would mean that there is a lot of configuration for these microservices that the operations team 
needs to manage. Spring cloud config server provides an approach where you can store all configuration for all the 
different environment of all the microservices in a Git repository. So you can store all the configuration for different 
environments of different microservices in just one place in a centralized location and spring cloud config server can 
be used to expose that configuration to all the microservices.

## 2.2 Dynamic ScaleUp
	* Euraka - Naming server
	* Rebbon - client side load balancing
	* Feign - Easier rest client

`60_RebonLoadBlancing.PNG`

MicroService is called currency calculation service which is talking to the currency exchange service. As you can see in
the diagram there are multiple instances of the currency exchange service and it's possible that at any point in time 
new instances can be added in or removed out. And we would want the currency calculations that we'd want to be able to 
distribute the load between all the instances of the currency exchange service. Who would want to be able to dynamically
check what are the available instances of the currency exchange service and make sure that the load is distributed among
all of them.

The solution which we would be discussing in this course would be using a naming server which is Eureka. So all the 
instances of all MicroServices would register with the naming server. So the naming server has two important features.
One is service registration so all microservices. Can register  with the microservice.

the second one is service discovery. So in this example the currency calculation service can ask the Eureka naming 
server Hey naming server URLs to the currency calculations. this helps to establish dynamic relationship between the 
currency calculation service and the instances of the currency exchange service. We will use Ribbon for client side load
balancing. That means the currency calculation service  will host ribbon and it would make sure that the load is evenly 
distributed among the existing instances that it gets from the naming server 

we'll also use Feign in the currency calculation service as a mechanism to write simple RESTful clients

## 2.3 Visibility and monitoring
	* Zipkin  - distributed Tracing server
	* Netflix - API gateway
	
the solutions for visibility and monitoring are the zipkin distributing Tracing Server. We would use Spring cloud Sloat 
to assign ID to request across multiple components.

and we would use the Zipkin distributed tracing to trace a request across multiple components.

One of the important things about microservices is these microservices have a lot of common feature.
    - For example logging security analytics and things like that you don't want to implement all these common features 
    in every microservice. API Gateways provide great solutions to these kind of challenges. We will use a Netflix Zuel 
    API gateway in this could.

## 2.4 Fault Tolerance
	* Hystrix
We will also implement fault tolerance using hystrix,
    -if a service is down. Hystrix help us to configure a default response.
    
## (3) Advantages

## 3.1 new technology and process adaption.
Architecture is the most important advantage of the MicroServices architecture is that it enables you to adapt new 
technology and processes very easy. When they build applications as a combination of microservices which can communicate
 with each other using simple messages each of these microservices can be built in different technologies. Typical more 
 nolet applications people would not have that flexibility. 
 
    - `58_pack of cards.PNG` For example Microservice one might be java MicroService two  might be Nodejs Microservice 
    three might be written in Kotlin and tomorrow there might be a language X Y Z which is really doing well and which 
    provides a lot of benefits to you and you can easily create a micro service in that specific language. And also for 
    the new Microservices that we create we can bring in new processors as well. 
    
## 3.2 Dynamic scaling.
The other important advantage of Microservices is Dynamic scaling consider an online shopping application like Amazon.
They don't really have the same amount of load or same amount of traffic or same amount of users throughout the year 
especially during the holiday season. The load on the application will be a lot and during the rest of the year there 
might not be so much load during the Black Friday there might be a huge amount of load. If your microServices are cloud 
enabled they can scale dynamically and you can procure hardware and release that dynamically as well. So you can scale 
up your applications and scale them down based on the Load because you're developing smaller components. 

## 3.3 Faster Release cycle
It's much easier to release micro services compared to monolith applications. This means that you can bring new features
faster to market and that's a big advantage to have in the modern world.

# (5)  Limits Microservice and Spring Cloud Config Server

## 5.1 intro
`61_limite_microService_ConfigServer.PNG`

we would be creating something called currency calculation service currency exchange service. But the most important 
thing that you would need to understand is each of these micro services has its own configuration. I would not be 
surprised of hearing that enterprises with more than 100 200 micro services. So each of these micro services have their 
own configuration. This configuration might be things like database configuration or any external service configuration 
or the typical business logic configuration as well.
There are a huge variety of things that would need to be configured for each microService the thing is there are multiple 
environment for each of these micro services

`62_concurrencyConversion.PNG`

for example the currency conversion service might be having Two QA environments and one each of all others 

`63_concurrency_ExchangeService.PNG`

the currency exchange service might have a lot of load on it and it has four production environments. And two QA environments.


 And so what we are talking about is the fact that there are multiple microServices sometimes hundreds of them and for 
each of these microServices there are multiple environments. And some of these environement might have multiple 
instances of the same Microservice. So we are talking about managing configuration of a lot of different instances of 
different micro services managing the configuration individually for each application each environment is a very very 
difficult thing. And that's where centralized configuration comes into picture 

* spring cloud config server says:

OK. You put all the configuration for you applications in a git repository. And I would take care of managing the 
configuration and providing it to the specific microService

* if limits services says: 

OK I would want the configuration for dev environment for limits service. The spring cloud conflict server would be able
to provide it 

* if currency calculation services:

OK I would do want the configuration for the third instance of the production environment spring cloud config server 
would be able to provide a 


spring cloud config server would act as the centralized Microservice configuration application all that you would need 
to do is to put all the configuration for these applications for different environment in a git repository and you can 
connect the spring

## 5.1 Creating Limit-service

`67_createLimtService.PNG`
- goto https://start.spring.io/
- get latest Spring version (don't get snapshot)
- add dependancy -> dev tools, web, actuator, config client
